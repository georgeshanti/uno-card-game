# UNO card game
I created during the COVID-19 breakout when the whole world essentially went into lockdown and everyone was stuck at home.
My college friends and I would regularly play UNO in class during our final semester of college cause we had nothing better to do. So to bring that back now when we had nothing better to do than be bored out of our mind, I made this.

Express+Sequelize+React = UNO
